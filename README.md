  <summary><h1>What is HAARCASCADES</h1></summary>
  Haar cascade is an algorithm that can detect objects in images, irrespective of their scale in image and location. This algorithm is not so complex and can run in real-time.
  In this specific project we are using a pre-trained model to detect faces.:computer:

  <summary><h2>Functionality</h2></summary>
  This project uses the device's inbuilt or external camera to capture and detect the face in the captured frame.
  
  **NOTE: The project's code may need to be altered in order to setup USB/external webcams.**
  
  1. The output is displayed in a seperate window and has a green rectangle outlining the face.
  2. The captured image and output image is saved in the same directory.
  3. The face detected also has a counter in order to experiment how the Model detects the faces in the captured frame.

# USAGE

  <p>OR Download as .ZIP. </p>
  Run face recog.py and make sure to keep '<i>haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml</i>'
  in the same directory.
  The images will be saved in there as well.:smile:<p>
